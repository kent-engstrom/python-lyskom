		      LysKOM support for Python


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

  This is good stuff. Use it.


HACKER SUMMARY

  This distribution contains modules to enable Python programs to talk
  to LysKOM servers, and applications using these modules. Highlights:

  Basic LysKOM modules
  --------------------

- The kom.py module contains basic Protocol A support for clients.
  It implements all non-obsolete requests in level 10 of the protocol.
  The module is completely implemented in Python, which means that it's
  convenient to use but rather slow. In addition to the most basic
  Connection class, a CachedConnection class is provided. It offers
  some basic caching and convenience methods.

- The thkom.py module offers the ThreadedConnection class,
  which is kom.Connection with support for Python threads.
  Read more about it in the comment at the top of the file.
  There are two small demonstration programs thkomdemo[12].py to
  show the main new feature.

  Importing mail
  --------------

- Importing mail into LysKOM is the purpose of komimportmail.
  It has support for MIME, threading and all the nice, new
  aux-items.

- rfc1522.py is a helper module that decodes MIME-encoded
  mail header lines.

- mimereader.py provides the Message class that ties together
  Python's mimetools and multifile modules in order to 
  simplify reading MIME mail.

- lockingshelve.py is a helper module providing a shelve module
  with locks around all operations.

- lockfile.py is a helper module used to implement the locking
  need by the above module.

  Other program
  -------------

  Some are really useful (like komshow) while others should
  be considered simple demo programs.

- komshow dumps information about conferences, persons and texts,
  including aux-items.

- komsend posts a text to a LysKOM conference (or mailbox).
  It can set arbitrary aux-items on the text.

- kommsg sends a message to a LysKOM conference or person.

- komgraph emits a VCG graph of a LysKOM article tree. You need
  a VCG program like xvcg to view the result.

- komunread displays a line to stdout for each unread letter you
  have in your letterbox.

- komwho shows a list of logged in persons.

- komparam.py is a helper module used by the programs above to
  learn server address, server port, person name/number and password
  from environment variables and/or a "~/.komrc" file.

- komconfwalker.py defines a class ConfTemporalWalker used to walk a
  conference, processing articles written during a specified
  period. This can be used for gathering various statistics (see
  below).

- komconfstats gives you statistics about a conference.

- komconfwords gives you information about new words used in a
  conference since last run.
