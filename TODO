THINGS TO DO WITH THE STUFF IN THIS DIRECTORY

* komimportmail
** Add time logging
** Check what exit code is used for "already present" (duplication)
** Check AI_MX_IN_REPLY_TO semantics (should we include what we really used?)
** mail2kom can use recode - should we do that too?
** Database issues
*** Can we do automatic GC or at least GC while the import is allowed to run?
*** Can we use MySQL or some other database instead for more advanced locking?
** Profile and optimize (it's rather slow now)
** Get rid of ugly #!/usr/bin/python-1.5.2
** Automatic rotation of maillog

** Client issues
*** elisp
**** Wrong author name displayed when writing a comment
*** WinKOM
*** JysKom

* kommove: batch article mover for moderators
** add conference to from-set?
** batch-below-this-node?
** Ability to evacuate all messages from a conference

* New programs
** komdump: dump a tree of texts
*** Rather trivial application of komwalk and komformat

* Documentation
** Include GPL statements everywhere
** Provide Changelog and NEWS
** Write installation instructions w.r.t. sendmail
** Document own aux-items (here or in Protocol-A docs)

* Almost unrelated
** Received: displayer
** mailmapper
Write a program that inputs one or more letters, with a lot of
Received:-lines, and emits a map (in VCG format) of the various paths
