THINGS TO DO WITH THE STUFF IN THIS DIRECTORY

* komimportmail
** Add LOGLEVEL configuration setting
*** Levels: ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, ...
*** Command line flag (need better parsing)

** Check what exit code is used for "already present" (duplication)
** Check AI_MX_IN_REPLY_TO semantics
** multipart/alternative with text/plain and text/html: zap HTML!

** mail2kom can use recode - should we do that too?
** Is there any need for decoding of ?B? headers?
** Implement GC for backlinks
** Tests
*** Test GC in real life situation: is it working? is it locking OK?
*** Profile and optimize (it's rather slow now)
** Get rid of ugly #!/usr/bin/python-1.5.2

** Client issues
*** WinKOM
*** JysKom

* New programs
** kommove: batch article mover for moderators
*** give --root and --from on command line
*** show articles (~ 10 lines of text)
*** ask for every text what to do:
**** leave as-is
**** leave as-is, prune (do not continue to recurse)
**** move to named conference
**** move to conference used earlier (by number)
**** add conference to from-set?
**** batch-below-this-node

* Other programs

* Documentation
** Include GPL statements everywhere
** Provide Changelog and NEWS
** Write installation instructions w.r.t. sendmail
** Document own aux-items (here or in Protocol-A docs)
