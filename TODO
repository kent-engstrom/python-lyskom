THINGS TO DO WITH THE STUFF IN THIS DIRECTORY

* komimportmail
** Add LOGLEVEL configuration setting
** Check what exit code is used for "already present" (duplication)
** Fix AI_MX_MISC and AI_MX_MIME_MISC overlap
** Write installation instructions w.r.t. sendmail
** How are we going to thread articles that arrive in bad order?
*** Keep "backward links" in message-id database
Normal entry:  Message-ID --> (textno, added_time_t)
Backwards link: Message-ID --> [list of textnos that want to comment this ID]
Garbing backlinks could prove time consuming
Backlink feature can use much disk --> make it optional
** Tests
*** Test GC in real life situation: is it working? is it locking OK?
*** Profile and optimize (it's rather slow now)
** Get rid of ugly #!/usr/bin/python-1.5.2
** multipart/alternative with text/plain and text/html: zap HTML!
** mail2kom can use recode - should we do that too?
** Is there any need for decoding of ?B? headers?
 
* Support in the elisp client
** Author in kom-list-summary

* General
** Include GPL statements everywhere
** Provide Changelog and NEWS
** Write some documentation
